# Dino Panic

A small versus game made for campjam 2015.

# Dependencies

This game depends on two libraries: SDL2 and GFraMe.

SDL2 can be obtained from the library's site
(https://www.libsdl.org/) while SDL2 can be obtained from its
repository (https://github.com/SirGFM/GFraMetree/devel). Note
that you must use the library's 'devel' branch! So, after
cloning it, you must checkout the correct branch. To do so,
simply run:

```
$ git checkout devel
```

# Compiling and running

To compile the game, open simply a terminal and run:

```
$ make RELEASE=yes
```

Before running the game, make sure the assets folder is on
the same depth as the binary. Also, be sure to get all the
assets from the release v1.0
(https://github.com/SirGFM/campjam15/releases/tag/v1.0).
